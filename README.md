# sawtooth_project

Using SDSS DR14 data to study the IGM transmission (measuring effective tau for Lyman series)
- see mock_spectra branch for the code creating mock spectra for the Lyman alpha forest
- see mcmc_result branch for testing code in fitting tau to SDSS DR14 data
  
Repository:
 - sawtooth_project: main scripts for the project
 - original_files: input files (wavelength, flux, covariance)
 - covariance_matrix: visualization and analysis for the covariance matrix
 - final_results: final results for unabsorbed continuum estimation and tau measurement from the MCMC sampler
